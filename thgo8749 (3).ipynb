    "My process for this project was to first make work through and make the functions work. This took me a while, and I had to rewatch a couple of the lecture videos to understand how to implement the code. At times, it was quite frustrating having to debug or translate the pseudocode. For example, it took me longer than I expected to create the FME function as I forgot that there may have been an infinite loop. Something I wish I had done was fully master and understand the content before starting on the project. I think I would have saved a lot of time by not having to rewatch the lectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I finally got my Decode() and Encode() to work, it was one of the most rewarding processes I have felt. It made me feel so accomplished and I loved the feeling that I could follow the steps on my own. Since I do not come from as diverse a background in math as other students, I hoped that I may be able to understand or figure out this project. I do think that some of the topics of RSA algorithms took a long time to wrap my head around. However, writing this program helped me understand how the algorithm worked and why certain numbers needed to be in certain places. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exchanging keys with classmates was the most entertaining part of this whole project. I think that it allowed me to understand that these concepts can be applied to the 'real world' and that they work. The first time I was decoding my messages, the decode wasn't working. I had to go into each function and use print statements to try and debug and see what went wrong. Something that helped me was asking other students questions and trying to figure out which function went wrong. However, what ended up being the problem was that I picked primes that were way too small! I forgot that the primes needed to be big enough for the modulo to be translated into letters, and I thought choosing small primes would make my first trial a lot easier. When I realized my mistake I felt so silly and yet I felt so rewarded that I could finally encode and decode messages! \n",
    "\n",
    "I think what helped me most with my project was the lecture videos and asking classmates for help. For example, when I was dealing with my Decode() function not working, I asked my classmates what their common errors were when dealing with problems with that function. It was really helpful because many of them tried to steer me in the right direction, with suggestions such as looking to see if my FME function was working properly. I liked their advice as it didn't give me any of the answers and allowed me to figure them out on my own. Another resource I found helpful was Khan Academy and the Python website for Python syntax. Using the Khan Academy from our first week of RSA helped me understand the fundamentals of the algorithm. In the beginning, I was feeling extremely confused with the private and public keys how the formulas worked, or why binary was important. These details began to feel overwhelming, so going back and reviewing the basics was extremely helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Something I enjoyed about this project was that I felt like I understood how to use Python and manipulate the syntax to get the result I wanted. The Python website was useful when I forgot how to implement syntax such as .join() or others. I was having a lot of fun debugging and finding solutions to problems. I think this project helped me solidify that I am choosing the right path. I am excited about the prospects of having more coding challenges and learning more fundamentals of computer science! Before starting the project, I was extremely nervous about my ability to understand the content and implement the code. After trial and error on my own, I am feeling confident about my problem-solving abilities and my understanding of the formulas!\n",
    "\n",
    "Something I will take with me for future projects is to start early. Looking over projects, starting to make small functions, or even just trying to estimate how long the project will take are super important factors to a coding project. Although I think I did give myself enough time, I feel like starting even earlier would have given me more time to think through how I wanted to problem solve instead of just going from kernel to the next kernel. I also think that taking moe time and watching all the lectures twice would have helped me understand RSA and primes and how they work. "

    "RSA needs to use a FME function because the modulo function is not sufficient enough in the use of large numbers. Using % on extremely large numbers would be computationally expensive. RSA also involves rasing a message to the public key 'e', which is usually a large exponent. Decryption of this involves raising the messages to another large exponent in the private key 'd'. The modulo operator would require so much computing, while the FME does not as it converts these numbers to binary and saves alot of computing power. Instead of computing the whole number by modulo, the FME can break down the exponentation into smaller parts and use a modulo at each step instead of on a huge number. For example, as 'n' increases, the runtime of modulo grows significantly. However, the runtime of FME does not increase significantly. \n",

    "Code breaking works by factorizing (with the Factorize(n) function) and finding the smallest factor of 'n' from the public key 'n,e'. When you can factorizing n, you can find the prime 'p'. Using this p, you can find q by dividing the 'n' by the p. Now, we have both p and q. Now, we can use our function \"Find_Private_Key_d(e,p,q)\" with our new values p and q as well as the 'e' from the public key. This function will find the totient ((p-1) * (q-1)) and compute the modular inverse of e modulo totient. We now have found the 'd' for the private key, and we can use it as an exponent to decode the message. Since we have the function \"Decode(n,d, cipher_text)\", we can put our 'n' from the public key, our newly found 'd', and the encrypted message into the function and it will use d as an exponent and n as the modulo to decrypt each part in the message and give us the decoded message. \n",
